Description: A set of tools for the peak filtering of mass spectrometry
  imaging data (MSI or IMS) based on spatial distribution of signal. Given a 
  region-of-interest (ROI), representing the spatial region where the informative
  signal is expected to be localized, a series of filters determine which peak
  signals are characterized by an implausible spatial distribution. The filters
  reduce the dataset dimensionality and increase its information vs noise ratio,
  improving the quality of the unsupervised analysis results, reducing data
  dimensionality and simplifying the chemical interpretation.
